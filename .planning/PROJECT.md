# Flare Football — On-Device Object Detection

## What This Is

A mobile feasibility POC evaluating whether YOLO11n can run real-time, on-device soccer ball detection and tracking on Flutter for both iOS and Android. The app detects soccer balls via camera, tracks their movement across frames, draws a visual trail showing the ball's path, and displays a "Ball lost" badge when tracking is interrupted. Built as an internal engineering study to determine whether to invest in this feature for the real Flare Football product.

## Core Value

Real-time soccer ball detection and tracking must run on-device with acceptable speed and accuracy on both iOS and Android — no cloud inference, no perceptible lag.

## Requirements

- ✓ "Ball lost" badge overlay when ball missing for 3+ frames — v1.1

### Active

(None — planning next milestone)

### Out of Scope

- Production UI polish or design system — POC only
- User authentication, accounts, or sessions — not needed for evaluation
- Uploading or persisting detection/tracking results — POC only
- Server-side / cloud inference — on-device is the core constraint
- Video recording or playback — not evaluating this
- Predictive tracking (estimating ball position when occluded) — happy path first
- Multi-ball tracking — single ball is the target use case
- Speed/velocity metrics or analytics — just the visual trail for now
- **SSD MobileNet / TFLite tracking** — model is old; YOLO only going forward

## Context

- **Flutter app** (49 Dart files, ~3,264 LOC) with YOLO as the primary ML pipeline: `DETECTOR_BACKEND=yolo`
- **SSD MobileNet path** exists in code for reference but is frozen — no new features
- **YOLO path** uses `ultralytics_yolo: ^0.2.0` with `YOLOView` widget. `onResult` callback fires per frame with detection results. Native bounding boxes disabled via `showOverlays: false`
- **Ball tracking** via `BallTracker` service with 1.5s time-windowed `ListQueue`, occlusion sentinels, and 30-frame auto-reset. `TrailOverlay` CustomPainter renders fading dot trail with connecting lines
- **"Ball lost" badge** appears at top-right after 3 consecutive missed frames (~100ms), disappears on re-detection
- **Custom YOLO11n model** trained on 3 classes: `Soccer ball`, `ball`, `tennis-ball`. Labels embedded in model
- **Camera aspect ratio** is 4:3 (`ultralytics_yolo` uses `.photo` session preset on iOS: 4032×3024)
- **Target devices:** iPhone 12 (A14 Bionic, iOS 17.1.2), Samsung Galaxy A32 (SM-A325F, Android 12)
- **Dev environment:** MacBook Pro (M5, 16GB), Flutter 3.38.9, Dart 3.10.8, Xcode 26.2
- **Known limitation:** Tracking quality described as "very poor" on iPhone 12 — may be a model limitation rather than code issue
- **Known gap:** Galaxy A32 Android testing deferred — Android SDK not configured on dev Mac
- **Shipped milestones:** v1.0 (Detection Feasibility), v1.1 (Ball Tracking)

## Constraints

- **Framework**: Flutter/Dart — existing codebase, cannot change
- **ML packages**: `ultralytics_yolo ^0.2.0` — do not upgrade without testing
- **On-device only**: No network calls for inference or tracking
- **YOLO only**: Tracking features on YOLO pipeline only (SSD path frozen)
- **Performance**: Tracking logic must not cause visible jank — inference already runs on separate thread, tracking overhead must be minimal
- **Landscape lock**: YOLO screen is landscape-only, tracking UI must respect this

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| YOLO11n nano over larger variants | Prioritise speed and on-device compatibility for POC | ✓ Good |
| Platform-native model formats (TFLite / Core ML) | Best performance per platform | ✓ Good |
| Model files gitignored | Large binaries managed outside VCS | ✓ Good |
| Landscape-only for YOLO screen | Matches realistic phone orientation for filming a pitch | ✓ Good |
| Background isolate for TFLite inference | Prevents UI jank during CPU-intensive work | ✓ Good |
| SSD/TFLite path dropped from v1.1 | Model is old; not worth investing in tracking for it | ✓ Scope reduction |
| `showOverlays: false` on YOLOView | Confirmed working; custom overlay is only rendering layer | ✓ Good |
| Camera AR = 4:3 (not 16:9) | ultralytics_yolo `.photo` session preset on iOS = 4032×3024 | ✓ Good (fixed ~10% Y-offset) |
| Time-windowed ListQueue for trail | Bounded memory, automatic eviction of old positions | ✓ Good |
| Occlusion sentinels (not separate list) | Simpler data structure, gap positions preserved in sequence | ✓ Good |
| Min-distance dedup in BallTracker | Prevents dot clustering at ~30fps during slow movement | ✓ Good |
| `Positioned` must be direct Stack child | IgnorePointer goes inside Positioned, not outside — Flutter constraint | ✓ Good (fixed runtime crash) |
| ballLostThreshold = 3 frames | ~100ms at 30fps — fast enough to feel responsive | ✓ Good |
